affect our behavior and thus our entire life. According to the Plunchik wheel of emotions, some of the 
most basic emotions are anger, worthlessness, fear, sadness, and joy. These serve as guides in our lives 
and play important roles in our decisions. Emotions also warn us of dangers in external life and protect

containing Contempt and Joy emotions were examined and these emotions were generally divided into 
4 emoji categories. There are 2000 data in total, 500 data in each category. The aim of the project is to
